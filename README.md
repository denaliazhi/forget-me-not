<br>**What was I supposed to say here?** Oh right, keep the brain "frog" away by playing this game.

### 🎮 Features
- Each round features a random set of stickers from [GIPHY](https://developers.giphy.com/)
- Each time you click a sticker, it shuffles the position of all stickers on the board
- Clicking the same sticker twice ends the round
- Track how many stickers you've clicked during a round
- Track your highest score across rounds
- You're not limited to frogs: choose from one of three sticker themes!
- Click on the "?" button to review the rules

### 👩🏻‍💻 Technical details
This app was my submission for the [Memory Card Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card) in TOP's[^1] Fullstack Javascript path

#### Premise
Create a React app that fetches data from an API for a memory game.

#### 🔨 Enhancements
If I were to revisit this project at a later date, I'd want to tackle the following:
- If user successfully clicks each sticker in a round exactly once, then start a new round but keep increasing the score from the round before
- Add option to generate a variable size grid of stickers
- Add time-based difficulty levels
- Make game display mobile-responsive
